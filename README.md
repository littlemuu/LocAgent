> [!NOTE]
> [CodeNib](https://github.com/sysevol-ai/CodeNib) serves LocAgent's search and graph-navigation tools from reusable, manifest-backed symbol-graph and BM25 indexes, without building a separate LocAgent index. The CodeNib integration starts from a prepared `repo_manifest.json` and runs LocAgent's localization policy over these indexes; model training and the original reproduction pipeline remain in this repository.

## ℹ️ Overview
We introduce **LocAgent**, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation.
By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures and their dependencies, enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning.

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:gersteinlab/LocAgent.git
   cd LocAgent

   conda create -n locagent python=3.12
   conda activate locagent
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Local asynchronous service (Stages 2–5)

FastAPI + PostgreSQL + isolated worker processes provide durable task submission,
idempotency, expiring leases, cancellation, bounded safe retries and fenced writes.
The default demo uses a scripted provider inside the real LocAgent tool loop;
it makes no paid calls.

~~~sh
docker compose up --build -d --wait
curl --noproxy '*' http://127.0.0.1:18080/health
curl --noproxy '*' -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18080/tasks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Idempotency-Key: demo-001' \
  -d '{"problem_statement":"Locate render."}'
# Poll /tasks/<id>; inspect /tasks/<id>/attempts.
# Stop services but KEEP the database volume:
docker compose down
~~~

Open http://127.0.0.1:18080/docs. Compose creates its own project-scoped volume
and leaves the historical Stage 2 volume untouched. It is a local-only profile,
with PostgreSQL isolated on an internal network and paid providers disabled.

The existing WSL demo remains available:
python -m locagent_service.demo up|run|down (API port 8000, retained Stage 2 DB).
The up command explicitly migrates schema v1 to v2; interrupted historical tasks
become needs_review and are never automatically replayed.

- [Stage 3 acceptance](STAGE3_ACCEPTANCE.md): leases, fencing, failure injection and limitations.
- [Stage 4 acceptance](STAGE4_ACCEPTANCE.md): fixed commit/sample/index manifests,
  paired evaluation, budget ledger, explicit local .env loading and the completed live pilot.
- [Stage 5 acceptance](STAGE5_ACCEPTANCE.md): clean Compose startup, closure, crash recovery and reproduction.
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md): process ownership, state transitions and billing boundaries.
- [Stage 2 historical acceptance](STAGE2_ACCEPTANCE.md): original MVP and baseline evidence.

~~~sh
# No model/network calls; original tests plus service/evaluation regressions:
sh scripts/check_local.sh
# Requires the retained local PostgreSQL container, or LOCAGENT_DATABASE_URL:
sh scripts/check_local.sh --postgres
# Builds image and verifies a fresh isolated volume; retains all volumes:
sh scripts/check_local.sh --compose
~~~

Do not interpret fixture message reduction as real quality or cost improvement.
Real provider execution requires an existing locally configured key, an explicitly
enabled paid run, a v2 six-call plan and a fresh plan-bound account pricing confirmation.
The --live switch applies only to the process; it does not modify .env. Legacy plans
are offline-only. The approved single-sample pilot completed six real calls; both arms
ranked the target file/function first, and the enabled arm folded six repeated tool returns.
This development sample does not establish general quality or cost improvements.
The one-time approval is consumed and full reservations remain retained; do not replay it.
Unknown paid outcomes halt for review; this service does not claim exactly-once model execution.

## 🚀 Launch LocAgent
1. (Optional but recommended) Parse the codebase for each issue in the benchmark to generate graph indexes in batch.
   ```
   python dependency_graph/batch_build_graph.py \
         --dataset 'czlll/Loc-Bench_V1' \
         --split 'test' \
         --num_processes 50 \
         --download_repo
   ```
   - `dataset`: select the benchmark (by default it will be `SWE-Bench_Lite`); you can choose from `['czlll/SWE-bench_Lite', 'czlll/Loc-Bench_V1']`(adapted for code localization) and SWE-bench series datasets like `['princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite', 'princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified', 'princeton-nlp/SWE-bench']`
   - `repo_path`: the directory where you plan to pull or have already pulled the codebase
   - `index_dir`: the base directory where the generated graph index will be saved
   - `download_repo`: whether to download the codebase to `repo_path` before indexing

2. Export the directory of the graph indexes and the BM25 sparse index. If not generated in advance, the graph index will be generated during the localization process.
   ```
   export GRAPH_INDEX_DIR='{INDEX_DIR}/{DATASET_NAME}/graph_index_v2.3'
   export BM25_INDEX_DIR='{INDEX_DIR}/{DATASET_NAME}/BM25_index'
   ```

2. Run the script `scripts/run_lite.sh` to lauch LocAgent.
   ```
   python auto_search_main.py \
      --dataset 'czlll/SWE-bench_Lite' \
      --split 'test' \
      --model 'azure/gpt-4o' \
      --localize \
      --merge \
      --output_folder $result_path/location \
      --eval_n_limit 300 \
      --num_processes 50 \
      --use_function_calling \
      --simple_desc
   ```
   - `localize`: set to start the localization process
   - `merge`: merge the result of multiple samples
   - `use_function_calling`: enable function calling features of LLMs. If disabled, codeact will be used to support function calling
   -  `simple_desc`: use simplified function descriptions due to certain LLM limitations. Set to False for better performance when using Claude.

3. Evaluation
   After localization, the results will be saved in a JSONL file. You can evaluate them using `evaluation.eval_metric.evaluate_results`. Refer to `evaluation/run_evaluation.ipynb` for a demonstration.

Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code snippets.The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the target code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies.We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through a graph-guided agent.By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures and their dependencies, enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning.Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization.Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86{\%} reduction), reaching up to 92.7{\%} accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12{\%} for multiple attempts (Pass@10).
